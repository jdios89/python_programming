- What does the program?: It simulates the lorenz attractor. The ODE solver is developed with the euler approach. 
- It runs with five cases that are under the cases folder
- How to run the program: install python, then locate with the terminal or ipython or spyder in the folder of cases.
                          run each of the cases and it will automatically save all the data generated and the figures,
                          in its own folder.  
- Testing the program: Locate in the test folder and run the python script. 

#

The cases and the test does not need to have the other modules loaded, it will do that automatically.

Here I will put an explanation of the lorenz attractor. 

Maybe I can put a test or two 
And how to launch all cases 

You can run the test case 1 as 

.. code-block:: python

    >>> python case1.py

And for test case 2

.. code-block:: python 

    >>> python case2.py

and so on

.. code-block:: python

    >>> python case3.py
    >>> python case4.py
    >>> python case5.py

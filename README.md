# Python programming assignment

A repository containing a mini project template for the
course "Scientific Computing using Python, part 1", held
at Aalborg University, May 2017

#
Here you can put a bit of information/documentation of the program
you develop, including:

- Author: Juan de Dios Flores Mendez
- What does the program?: It simulates the lorenz attractor. The ODE solver is developed with the euler approach. 
- Same as supplied
- How to run the program: install python, then run it. 

#
you might need to put something like, i just did

import sys\n
sys.path.append('../')\n
import lorenz

in e.g. cases/case1.py or test/test.py to be access the functions etc.
you make in lorenz/solver.py, lorenz/run.py etc.
